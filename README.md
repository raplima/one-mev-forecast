# one-mev-forecast
_by Rafael Pires de Lima and Yue Chen_

Relativistic electrons in Earth's outer radiation belt reach megaelectron‐volt (MeV) energy and pose a space weather threat for spaceborne electronics orbiting our planet. 

Ideally, stakeholders such as the space industry, service providers, and government agencies, would be able to forecast the increase in MeV electrons and take the necessary measurements to protect their assets.

In the following notebook, we use different data to forecast 1 MeV electrons using a machine learning approach. We rely on scikit-learn and TensorFlow packages to predict the flux distribution in selected L-shells.

The content we show is part of a bigger analysis published in the [Forecasting Megaelectron‐Volt Electrons Inside Earth's Outer Radiation Belt: PreMevE 2.0 Based on Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019SW002399) paper.
